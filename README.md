## Python
Once you have decided that Python is your language of choice for your data Analysis/Science project, download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads) from its website. You can use the Integreted Development Learning Environment (IDLE) that comes with python but for easier learning experience, you can choose another IDE of your choice with a simple google search. Once your python is ready, you can pip install the library you want to use and start your data analysis project.

## Basic Python Libraries
Python libraries are code modules that are used in solving python problems. Depending on the project, there are a number of libraries in Python for Data Analysts and Scientists alike. These include:
**Pandas**,
**Numpy**,
**Matplotlib**, 
 **Seaborn**,
 **Plotly**, 
 **Altair**, 
 **Scikit-learn**, etc.
## Steps in Using Python Libraries
**1** Visit the website of your library of choice to get familiar with its documentation.

**2** Pip install the library on your Personal computer (PC).

**3** Study how to use the library from from its website, google search, youtube video, chatgpt, deepseek and walaaaa! You can start solving problems.
## Pandas Library
Python [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html) is used for analysing structured or tabular data (data stored in rows and columns) popularly called ***dataframe***. You can learn more about Pandas from its [website](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html).
```Python
# Install Pandas
pip install pandas # for most IDEs
conda install -c conda-forge pandas  #for Anaconda or miniconda 
```

## Open Data File with Pandas
First, import Pandas.
```Python
import Pandas as pd
```
If data is saved in the same working directory, open the file with the file name else use the complete file path.
```Python
data = pd.read_csv("file name/file path")
```
***See []() for a  sample project that includes Pandas.
## Numpy Library
Numpy is used for creating arrays (data with rows and colums), manipulating data (especially in data mining), and applying mathematical functions. [Install](https://numpy.org/install/) numpy and check [how to use](https://numpy.org/doc/2.2/user/basics.creation.html#converting-python-sequences-to-numpy-arrays) numpy for further explanations.
## Matplotlib library
Matplotlib is a static graphical library for creating visualizations. Visit [matplotib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/quick_start.html#axis-scales-and-ticks) For a quick start on matplotlib. You can also check my []() for sample work that included matplotlib
